# mapthebrain.org
A website dedicated to curating an interactive mapping the parts of the brain

## Motivation

I was formerly trying to log my learnings at https://michaelkarpeles.com/curations/the-brain.

## Goal(s)

- Come up with a comprehensive list of parts of the brain (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_in_the_human_brain)
- Semantically resolve each of these terms to wikidata ids
- Construct a knowledge graph (map relationships) from these tags
- create a 3d webgl visual representation of the brain which one may navigate via keyboard or mouse
- allow the public to attach openannotations, research paper links, and other resources to different areas of the brain
